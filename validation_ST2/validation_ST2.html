					<p>During the validation process, I encountered several challenges, particularly with fixing HTML errors related to missing closing tags and CSS warnings about redundant rules. The W3C validation tools helped me quickly identify these issues and resolve them. While some of the warnings were not critical (e.g., unused CSS selectors), I took the time to clean up the code and ensure better performance.</p>

					<p>In addition, I learned the importance of accessibility validation. Some images were missing `alt` text, and I made sure to add descriptive alt attributes for each image to improve accessibility. This process highlighted how important it is to write semantically correct and well-structured code.</p>

					<p>Although most errors were resolved, there were some warnings about browser compatibility for certain CSS properties. I’ve noted these and will continue to monitor their impact on different browsers. Overall, the validation process was invaluable in helping me refine my code and improve the quality of my project.</p>
