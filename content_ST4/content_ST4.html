			   <p style="color: chartreuse;" align="Left">Sustainable forestry means managing forests in a way that will keep forests healthy and usable for local communities and society as a whole for generations to come .To make consistent change, sustainable forestry requires a set of practices that promote environmental responsibility, social equity, and viable economic growth.</p> 
               <h3 align="Left">Here are some sustainable forestry practices:</h3>
               
               <ul align="Left">

                <li>Follow local laws and maintain a sustainable forestry certification.</li>
                <li>Define tenure and use rights.</li>
                <li>Protect indigenous people's right.</li>
                <li>Priorities community relations and workers' rights.</li>
                <li>Balance forest resources and benefits with societal demand.</li>
                <li>Minimize environmental impact.</li>
                <li>Have a management plan.</li>
                <li>Monitor and assess regularly.</li>
                <li>Maintain high conservation value forests.</li>

               <h3 style="color:rgb(249, 249, 248);">Reforestation</h3>

               <p style="color: chartreuse;" align="Left">
                Reforestation can be defined as the process of replanting trees in areas that have been affected by natural disturbances like wildfires, drought and insect and disease infestations and unnatural ones like logging, mining, agricultural clearing and development. By planting trees in areas that have been degraded or deforested, reforestation helps the environment by guaranteeing or accelerating the re-establishment of healthy forest structure by regrowing the forest canopy and preserving biodiversity within the ecosystem.
